### Result & Outcomes
- MindBot offers tailored mental health support utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques and user interaction data.
- MindBot maintains its focus by exclusively responding to mental health- related inquiries, and redirecting users seeking other topics back to its primary aim.
- Through CBT-based guidance and topic limitation, MindBot fosters a supportive environment for users to address their mental health needs.
